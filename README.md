# Welcome to the My Summary Repository

This project was built with React, TypeScript, Material-UI, React-Twitter-Timeline, Finnhub, React IFrame, and various API's.

## About the Project
The purpose of the project is to provide a webapp that summarizes information such as weather, commute, news, social media, and stock market quotes neatly on a single page application.

The use of the application is straightforward and self-explanitory, as it guides you through set up and is very intuitive to use thereafter.

Do note that all data is stored locally, so changing browsers or clearing your cache will result in you needing to set up again.

If you have any input or encounter any issues, please reach out to me. Thank you!
