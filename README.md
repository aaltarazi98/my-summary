My Summary serves as a single page application that displays a summary of news, social network feeds, weather, commute, and ticker prices that you are interested in (no scrolling unless you are on mobile).

Begin your experience by visiting the link below and setting up your account. You can then enjoy content tailored for you served seemlessly to your front page. You can always change your interests by accessing the gear on the top right. Please note that all data is stored locally, opening a new browser or clearing your cache will require setting up again.
